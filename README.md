# boiler-login
<h2>Boiler Login</h2>
<p>A boilerplate of a basic login/registration system, that I will use in most of my projects.</p>
<h2>How to use this ?</h2>
<p>Install the project, then go to the terminal of your code editor, and run `npm init` and finally `node server.js` (to change later). You can now see your website on `http://localhost:3000/`</p>
<h2>What I learnt ?</h2>
<p>I learnt how to encrypt and decrypt a password, build a secure authentification and authorization system.</p>
